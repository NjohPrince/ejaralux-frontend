## ðŸ§± Architecture Strategy: Modular Monolith + Atomic Design

This project follows a `Modular Monolith Architecture` combined with `Atomic Design Principles` for the frontend to achieve a scalable, maintainable, and highly modular codebase.


### 1. Modular Monolith Architecture (Feature-Based)

The application is organized by domain features inside a `/modules` directory. Each module owns its own coponents, UI, services, helper functions and methods. This approach promotes 

- separation of concerns
- Mirrors backend structure for developer empathy and API alignment
- Improves code discoverability, scalability, and modularity

Each module is self-contained and may include:

- `components/`
- `lib/`
- `services/`
- `types/`

### 2. Atomic Design System (UI Components)

Within the `shared/components/` and each moduleâ€™s local `components/` folder, the UI is structured following the [Atomic Design methodology by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/):

| Layer         | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atoms     | Foundational UI elements (e.g., `button`, `input`, `Text`)      |
| Molecules | Simple combinations of atoms (e.g., `form-row`, `labelled-input`) |
| Organisms | Independent sections of UI (e.g., `product-table`, `order-card`)  |
| Templates | Page-level layouts with placeholders  

**Example structure representation:**

    shared/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ organisms/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ templates/

**Key Benefits:**

- Design consistency across modules
- Reusability and maintainability of UI elements
- Scalable across both developer teams and designers

**Combined Benefits:**

| Modular Monolith                 | Atomic Design                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Domain isolation (per feature)   | Visual consistency and reusability |
| Mirrors backend architecture     | Scales well with design systems    |
| Simplifies cross-functional work | Easier to test and maintain        |
| Faster onboarding for teams      | Clear UI layer separation          |

### ðŸ§  Architectural Reasoning

I chose to combine both approaches because they complement each other:

- Modular Monolith ensures the codebase remains maintainable, even as the app scales with features.
- Atomic Design ensures a consistent and reusable UI system while enabling low-level styling or component libraries like ShadCN, Chakra, or Tailwind CSS (if needed).

### ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This hybrid approach delivers a UI codebase that is:

- Scalable in features, team size, and complexity
- Maintainable over time through clear boundaries
- Reusable and consistent in design
- Aligned with backend architecture for full-stack coherence
